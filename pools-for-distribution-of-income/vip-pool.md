# VIP Pool

VIP pool also has a few sources of income (see chapter below). Let’s look how smart contract distributes ETH from this pool among users.

Only users with VIP cards can pretend to get paid from VIP pool.

User’s share in the pool in each moment of time = (**User’s ePower/ Total VIP ePower**), where Total VIP ePower is a sum of ePower of all users with VIP cards at the moment.

So the earlier user becomes a VIP the more ETH from the VIP pool he gets.
