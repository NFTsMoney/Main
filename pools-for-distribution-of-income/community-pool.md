# Community Pool

Community pool has a few sources of income (see chapter below). Let’s look how smart contract distributes ETH from this pool among users.

&#x20;Only users with standard cards can pretend to get paid from the community pool.

User’s share in the pool in each moment of time = (**User’s ePower/ Total ePower**), where Total ePower is a sum of ePower of all users with standard cards at the moment.

So the earlier user joins the community the more ETH from the community pool he gets.
