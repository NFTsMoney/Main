# Integrations into 3rd party’s collections

Integration is when 3rd party’s collection adds a few lines of our code into their smart contract to:

* give a personal discount on minting price to each and every NFTs Money Club card holder;
* share a part of ETH from minting their collection with NFTs Money Club smart contract;

After integration is done we make a promotion described above but with a difference that we don’t take any fees in advance.

All the ETH from integration is being distributed as any other external income.
