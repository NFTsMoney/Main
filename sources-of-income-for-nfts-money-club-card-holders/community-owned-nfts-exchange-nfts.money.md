# Community owned NFTs exchange (NFTs.money)

Once the amount of community members reaches 50,000 we are going to launch community owned NFT Marketplace â€“ **NFTs.money**.

We are sure that the right order is to build the community first and only after that to luanch NFT Marketplace. Not vice versa.

All the commissions from NFTs.money will be distributing as any other external income. Check [**ETH Distribution**](../eth-distribution/) chapter for details.
