# Upgrade standard card to VIP

There are 2 ways to upgrade your standard card to VIP card:

* You can upgrade your standard card to VIP card any time just by adding a difference between current VIP card price and standard card price. You can do it via front-end (feature is under development at the moment) or directly through the smart contract by calling **upgradeTokenToVIP **function.
* Your standard card will automatically become VIP card once your referral count reaches 100.
