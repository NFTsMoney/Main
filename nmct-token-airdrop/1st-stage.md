# 1st stage

The first stage will start once the amount of NFTs Money Club community members reaches 50,000. During this stage 40,000,000 NMCT will be distributed.

20,000,000 will be distributed among all users. Amount of tokens that every user gets will find out solving this simple equation:

&#x20;**x\*standard cards amount + 50\*x\*VIP cards amount = 20,000,000**

** **x – amount of NMCT tokens per standard card;

50x – amount of NMCT tokens per VIP card;

&#x20;The rest 20,000,000 will be distributed based on **directRefBonusBalance **property. The formula is following:

&#x20;**Amount = (directRefBonusBalance/ Total directRefBonusBalance)\*20,000,000**
